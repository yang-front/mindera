# To run this project follow steps below:

# Why this project was made? 

I lost almost all the time i had left trying to run and test the code on the devskiller platform.\
I left the test with the feeling that I could have done more.\
This is why i took some time today and built this project to show the test (and a bit more).\

Hope you Enjoy
